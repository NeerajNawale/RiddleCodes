            <h2>Hands-On Projects for Beginners</h2>
            <p class="paras">Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer
                program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves
                tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption,
                and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as
                coding).</p>
                <p class="paras">The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to
                programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit.
                Proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge
                of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic</p>

            <h2>Practice Codes</h2>
            <p class="paras">A project (or program) is any undertaking, carried out individually or collaboratively and
                possibly involving research or design, that is carefully planned (usually by a project team[citation
                needed]) to achieve a particular aim.
                An alternative view sees a project managerially as a sequence of events: a "set of interrelated tasks to
                be executed over a fixed period and within certain cost and other limitations".
                A project may be a temporary (rather than permanent) social system (work system), possibly constituted
                by teams (within or across organizations) to accomplish particular tasks under time constraints</p>

            <h2>Let's Grow Together</h2>
            <p class="paras">Team building is a collective term for various types of activities used to enhance social relations and define roles within teams, often involving collaborative tasks. It is distinct from team training, which is designed by a combine of business managers, learning and development/OD (Internal or external) and an HR Business Partner (if the role exists) to improve the efficiency, rather than interpersonal relations.

                These teams have built small ocean-going rafts as part of a team building exercise
                Many team-building exercises aim to expose and address interpersonal problems within the group.
                Over time, these activities are intended[by whom?] to improve performance in a team-based environment.[2] Team building is one of the foundations of organizational development that can be applied to groups such as sports teams, school classes, military units or flight crews.</p>
